# Monty Hall Problem
The Monty Hall problem is a brain teaser, in the form of a probability puzzle, loosely based on the American television game show Let's Make a Deal and named after its original host, Monty Hall. This project simulates the game.

## The Game
Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, "Do you want to pick door No. 2?" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?

## How To
Run the program in Xcode and it runs it on a command line interface. The instructions are very clear on how to respond to answers. Open the console.

If you run enough games and switch enough times, you can see in the end that you win a lot more by switching than not switching.
